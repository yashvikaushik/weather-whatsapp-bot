# 📡 API Endpoint

## POST `/webhook`

Receives WhatsApp messages and processes weather queries.

Example:

```python
@app.post("/webhook")
async def whatsapp_bot(Body: str = Form(...)):

    weather = get_weather_data(Body)

    suggestion = groq_llm(weather)

    return send_whatsapp_message(suggestion)
```

---

# 🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ User sends WhatsApp message (e.g. *"Weather in Delhi"*)  
2️⃣ Twilio sends webhook request to FastAPI  
3️⃣ Backend fetches weather data from API  
4️⃣ Groq LLM generates human-like weather suggestion  
5️⃣ Response is sent back via WhatsApp  

---

# 🧪 Example Query

User message:

```
Weather in Delhi today
```

Bot response:

```
The weather in Delhi today is 32°C with clear skies.
It’s a great day for outdoor activities but stay hydrated due to the heat.
```
